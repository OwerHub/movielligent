to run this program

    - you can get a key in https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

- to run unit- and integration tests, type                      npm tests 
    - this not working good before node v16

- to run integration tests, type                                npm e2e
    - in first time, the test failed in my comp, but its working perfectly since the second test
    - maybe you should allow acess in your firewall.
