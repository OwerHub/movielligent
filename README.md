# Moveilligent 

This is an interesting trial task. I have  connec to moviedatabase, cache the responses,  
create a favorit-list , store in a localstorage, etc. 

I used typescript, react, redux, and etc. 

A have write to tests, all-level.  Unit and integration test in jest,  e2e test in Cypress.
This is the first time with Cy, but I love it.. 



to run this program

- After clone this repository, type and run :                   npm install

- create an .env file, include REACT_APP_API_KEY=<your key> 
    - you can get a key in https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

- to run unit- and integration tests, type                      npm tests 
    - this not working good before node v16

- to run integration tests, type                                npm e2e
    - in first time, the test failed in my comp, but its working perfectly since the second test
    - maybe you should allow acess in your firewall. 


See ya later, and have a good hacking!
